# CoolRaytracing
Learning how to do Raytracing in C++ using SDL 2 Libraries, following QuantitativeBytes tutorial

This is a project I'm doing to take advantage of the fact that my classes have been paused for a bit. I always wanted to learn how to build a raytracer, and I think this is the perfect opportunity to do so.
I'm following QuantitativeBytes tutorials on YouTube, but making specific fixes/changes to work with Visual Studio & Windows.
My goal with this project is to build a fully functional, optimized, and performant raytracer aimed for Windows, considering QuantitativeBytes tutorial aims for Linux already.
