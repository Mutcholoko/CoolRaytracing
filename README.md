# CoolRaytracing
Learning how to do Raytracing in C++ using SDL 2 Libraries, following QuantitativeBytes tutorial

This is a project I'm doing to take advantage of the fact that my classes have been paused for a bit. I always wanted to learn how to build a raytracer, and I think this is the perfect opportunity to do so.
I'm following QuantitativeBytes tutorials on YouTube, but making specific fixes/changes to work with Visual Studio & Windows.
My goal with this project is to build a fully functional, optimized, and performant raytracer aimed for Windows, considering QuantitativeBytes tutorial aims for Linux already. The final project will be an executable that you can just open in any computer and start playing with raytracing.
